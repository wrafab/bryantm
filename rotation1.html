<h1> Rotation 1 </h1>
    <p> This was the first day of class and we had done some fun intro projects to Digital Fab.
    The fisrt activity
    we had did was to make a container out of straws to try and capture 
	a golfball from 6ft high. My group consisted of Megan, Dan, and Bakari.
    	My contribution to the group was to build and the neccassry parts for
	the both projects.</p>
